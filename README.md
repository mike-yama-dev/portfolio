# Welcome to my portfolio!

This is my solo hackathon! I'm taking this time to make a portfolio in as fast as possible in order to showcase working under pressure

# My hackathon date is December 26, 2024 started at 1:45PM. 

Here are the steps I have done and will log them as I go along 

- Bought domain name
- Create react app & initial commit to the github project 
- Created a vercel project, deployed the project to vercel via github 
- Transferred DNS to work with domain name
- Worked with GPT to write a normalize CSS to remove broswer specific styles to gain more control over the styling
- Installed emailJS package so this portfolio can be a front end only website (cost & performance effective)
- Worked with GPT to write me 4 components to write up the website faster. I like to use GPT as a tool to get me 70% of the way there, the less code I have to write, the more resources I have to put into other aspects of the project/task 
- Downloaded the neccessary images from google play and app store badges to properly have it linked
